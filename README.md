# Black-Jack.Java

 ** This is an application that I made with Java.  I made this throughout an Udemy course I bought.  I left the tasks to show what was asked in order to get the application run properly, but also to show how I completed the tasks to help the program function as intended.  This project uses variables, functions, and loops.
 
 ** This is something that I have been wanting to do for a while.  I enjoyed making this short game and look forward to making a hangman application next!
